## My process 
- Downloaded the files containing everything i needed for the challenge from frontend mentor
- Put them all in a new folder and opened the folder on VScode
- Created an html file and added the image, wrote texts using the h3 tag and p tag
- Created a CSS file and linked it to the html file using <link> tag
- Styled the html code to look exactly like the design should be followinf the required font size, font family, color pallete e.t.c That's it!


### What I learned
- I learnt how to center a div vertically and horizontally using some CSS properties
- I also learnt to style a card using 'box-shadow' effect
- i was able to play around with color paletes   

```css

.main {
  box-shadow: 0px 2px 15px hsl(220, 13%, 77%) ;
}
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 120px 0px;
}

```
### Continued development

- I want to focus now on the difference between margin and padding, i understand it literally but i want to focus on it in my upcoming projects
- Also i would focus on CSS position properties 

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This explained the CSS position properties. I really understood it and will use the various properties going forward.
